# workoutapp-mobile
This is a workout logger application built with React Native and firebase for real-time data synchronization.
Allows users to create, edit, delete, and complete workouts to log them to the firebase db. 

Within workouts there is also exercise manipulation by way of creating, editing, and deleting.
As of 10/17/17 this project has been on hold for several weeks.
